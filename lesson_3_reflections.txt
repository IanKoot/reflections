When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want this when you're collaborating with others, or working on multiple machines.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
You might only want to pull complete changes to your computer.
