-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me exactly which words were different, so I didn't have to look through the whole fil
e, comparing all the words. The words that were different but spelled normally, where intended 
changes, but the words that were spelled incorrectly were typos, creating bugs.
-How could having easy acces to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programme
r in the long term?
It makes it easier to catch bugs and look over changes you made.
-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you 
do in Git, vs having versions automatically saven, like Google Docs does?

h code. The downside is that there is a potential for human error.
-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
